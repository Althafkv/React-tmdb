3. In this application we'll use both class and functional components.

    - Functional Components:
        Functional components are simple. They are functions that take props as an argument and return React elements. With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components can also manage state and lifecycle events.
    - Class Components:
        Class components are ES6 classes that extend from React.Component. They have a more feature-rich API compared to functional components and can have local state, lifecycle methods, and other features.
